# Volunteer Map

I am building a tool so that habitat restoration volunteers can easily see the locations of weed management projects, track the progress of the restoration efforts, and volunteer to help. 

It has a map using react-leaflet, and I want clicking the markers to trigger showing data about the projects (treatment history, photos) alongside a volunteer form, and potentially a chat box to make coordinating volunteer projects easy.
